## ✅ Getting started
**InfCraft** is a game programmed in Java, it runs on the same engine as Minecraft (LWJGL 3 + Java 21).

### Why this project? 🤔
I created this project because Minecraft, because I haven't seen any good Minecraft InfDev forks out there,
this one does that most of them don't!
Such as our multiplayer implementation.
